* In Go, there is no ternanry operation, so if-else is necessary.
* Also, if-else statements also accept initializers (which is something a bit odd
coming from Java)
  * However, ~only one variable is accepted~ only shorthand syntax is accepted
  * One or more values can be initialized as long as the shorthand syntax is used
